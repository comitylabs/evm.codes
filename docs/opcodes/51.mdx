## Stack input

0. `Integer`: offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes.

## Stack output

0. `Integer`: the 32 bytes in [memory](/about) starting at that offset. If it goes beyond its current size (see [MSIZE](/#59)), writes 0s.

## Examples

| Memory |
|--------|
| `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000FF` |

| Input | Output | * | Input | Output |
|------:|-------:|---|-------|--------|
| `0` | `0xFF` | * | `1` | `0xFF00` |

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
