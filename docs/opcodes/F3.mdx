## Notes

## Stack input

0. `offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, to copy what will be the [return data](/about) of this [context](/about).
1. `size`: byte size to copy (size of the [return data](/about)).

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
