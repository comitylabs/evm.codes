## Stack input

0. `Integer`: value in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp) to send to the new account.
1. `Integer`: offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the instructions of the new account.
2. `Integer`: how many bytes to copy (size of the instructions).

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
