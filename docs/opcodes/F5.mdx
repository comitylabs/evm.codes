## Notes

Equivalent to [CREATE](/#F0), except the salt allows to be created at a deterministic address.

## Stack input

0. `Integer`: value in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp) to send to the new account.
1. `Integer`: offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the instructions of the new account.
2. `Integer`: length, how many bytes to copy (size of the instructions).
3. `Integer`: salt, 32-byte value used to create the new account at a deterministic address.

## Stack output

0. `Address`: the address of the deployed contract.

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- The current execution context is from a [STATICCALL](/#FA).
