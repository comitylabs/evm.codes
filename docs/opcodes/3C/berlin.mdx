## Dynamic gas

    minimum_word_count = (byte_count + 31) / 32
    dynamic_gas = {gasPrices|copy} * minimum_word_count + memory_expansion_cost + address_access_cost

The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).
If the accessed address is warm, `address_access_cost` is {gasPrices|warmstorageread}, otherwise it is {gasPrices|coldaccountaccess}. See section [access sets](/about).
