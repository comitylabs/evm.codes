## Notes

The [memory](/about) is always fully accessible. What this instruction tracks is the highest index that was used in the current execution. A first write to a bigger index will trigger a [memory](/about) expansion, which will cost gas.

## Stack output

0. `Integer`: current [memory](/about) size in bytes.

## Example

| Input | Output |
|------:|-------:|
| | `2848` |

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
