*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Stack input

0. `value`: value in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp) to send to the new account.
1. `offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the instructions of the new account.
2. `size`: byte size to copy (size of the instructions).

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- The current execution context is from a [STATICCALL](/#FA) (since Byzantium fork).
