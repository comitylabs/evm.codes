## Note

Semantically equivalent of calling [BALANCE](/#31) with [ADDRESS](/#30) as parameter, but with a reduced gas cost.

## Stack output

0. `Integer`: [base fee](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#base-fee) in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp).

## Example

| Input | Output |
|------:|-------:|
| | `125985` |

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
