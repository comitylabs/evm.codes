## Gas

    gas_cost = static_gas + dynamic_gas
    static_gas = {gasPrices|sstore}
    dynamic_gas =
        {gasPrices|sstoreSet} if the value is changed from zero to non-zero
        {gasPrices|sstoreReset} otherwise

## Gas refunds

If the value is changed from non-zero to zero, adds {gasPrices|sstoreRefund} to the gas refunds. See [gas refunds](/about).
