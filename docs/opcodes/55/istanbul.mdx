## Dynamic gas

If the new value is the same as the current value, then the cost is {gasPrices|sstoreNoopGasEIP2200}. Otherwise if the current value is not the original value, then the cost is {gasPrices|sstoreDirtyGasEIP2200}. Otherwise if the original value was zero, then the cost is {gasPrices|sstoreInitGasEIP2200}. Finally, in other cases the cost is {gasPrices|sstoreCleanGasEIP2200}.
