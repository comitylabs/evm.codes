## Notes

Creates a new sub [context](/about) and execute the [code](/about) of the given account, then resumes the current one. Note that an account with no code will return success as true.

If the size of the [return data](/about) is not known, it can also be retrieved after the call with the instructions [RETURNDATASIZE](/#3D) and [RETURNDATACOPY](/#3E) (since the Byzantium fork).

## Stack input

0. `Integer`: amount of gas to send to the sub [context](/about) to execute.
1. `Address`: the account which [context](/about) to execute.
2. `Integer`: [value](/#34) in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp) to send to the account.
3. `Integer`: offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the [calldata](/about) of the sub [context](/about).
4. `Integer`: how many bytes to copy (size of the [calldata](/about)).
5. `Integer`: offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, where to store the [return data](/about) of the sub [context](/about).
6. `Integer`: how many bytes to copy (size of the [return data](/about)).

## Stack output

0. `Boolean`: return 0 if the sub [context](/about) [reverted](/#FD), 1 otherwise.

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- The current execution context is from a [STATICCALL](/#FA) and the [value](/#34) (stack index 2) is not 0 (since Byzantium fork).
