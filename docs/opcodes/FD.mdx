## Notes

Stop the current context execution, revert the state changes (see [STATICCALL](/#FA) for a list of state changing opcodes) and return unused gas to the caller. If the execution is stopped with REVERT, the value 0 is put on the stack of the calling context, which continues to execute normally.
The [return data](/about) of the calling context is set as the given chunk of memory of this context.

## Stack input

0. `Integer`: offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes. The return data of the calling context.
1. `Integer`: length: how many bytes to copy (size of the [return data](/about).

## Examples

| Memory |
|-------:|
| `0xFF01` |

| Input |
|------:|
| `0` |
| `2` |

| Calling context return data |
|----------------------------:|
| `0xFF01` |

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
