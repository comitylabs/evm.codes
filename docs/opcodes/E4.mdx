*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Context from [CALLF](/#E3), The **RETF** instruction return value from a function or subroutine, which pop an execution state from return stack and set to corresponding values (current section index, program counter).

Static jump instructions are prefered, dynamic jump instructions are disallowed.

## Stack output

0. `value`: an execution state from return stack

*TBD: Reproduce in playground*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- Return stack is empty resulting in end execution or exceptionally halt.
