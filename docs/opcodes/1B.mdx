## Notes

Shift the bits towards the most significant one. The bits moved after the 256th one are discarded, the new bits are set to 0.

## Stack input

0. `shift`: number of bits to shift to the left.
1. `value`: 32 bytes to shift.

## Stack output

0. `value << shift`: the shifted value. If `shift` is bigger than 255, returns 0.

## Examples

| Input | Output |
|------:|-------:|
| `1` | `2` |
| `1` | |

| Input | Output |
|------:|-------:|
| `4` | `0xF000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` |
| `0xFF00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | |

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
