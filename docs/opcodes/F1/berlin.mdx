## Dynamic gas

    base_dynamic_gas = memory_expansion_cost + code_execution_cost

The `code_execution_cost` is the cost of the called code execution (limited by the `gas` parameter).
The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).

On top of the `base_dynamic_gas` can be added more gas cost:
 - If `address` is warm, then add {gasPrices|warmstorageread}. Otherwise add {gasPrices|coldaccountaccess}. See section [access sets](/about).
 - If `value` is not 0, then add {gasPrices|callValueTransfer}. In this case there is also a call stipend that is given to make sure that a basic fallback function can be called. {gasPrices|callStipend} is thus removed from the cost, and also added to the `gas` input.
 - If `value` is not 0 and the `address` given points to an empty account, add {gasPrices|callNewAccount}. An account is empty if its balance is 0, its nonce is 0 and it has no code.
