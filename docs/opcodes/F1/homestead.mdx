## Dynamic gas

    base_dynamic_gas = memory_expansion_cost + code_execution_cost

The `code_execution_cost` is the cost of the called code execution (limited by the `gas` parameter).
The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).

On top of the `base_dynamic_gas` can be added more gas cost:
 - If `value` is not 0, then add {gasPrices|callValueTransfer}.
 - If no account exists at the given `address`, add {gasPrices|callNewAccount}.
