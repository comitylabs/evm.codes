## Gas

    gas_cost = static_gas + dynamic_gas
    static_gas = {gasPrices|selfdestruct}
    dynamic_gas = new_account_gas + cold_account_access_gas

    new_account_gas = {gasPrices|callNewAccount} if a positive balance is sent to an empty account
    cold_account_access_gas = {gasPrices|coldaccountaccess} if `address` is cold

An account is empty if its balance is 0, its nonce is 0 and it has no code. See section [access sets](/about).
