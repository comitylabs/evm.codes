*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Creates a new sub [context](/about) and execute the [code](/about) of the given account, then resumes the current one. Note that an account with no code will return success status.

This instructions is equivalent to [EXTCALL](/#F8), except that it does not allow any state modifying instructions or sending ETH in the sub [context](/about). The disallowed instructions are [CREATE](/#F0), [CREATE2](/#F5), [LOG0](/#A0), [LOG1](/#A1), [LOG2](/#A2), [LOG3](/#A3), [LOG4](/#A4), [SSTORE](/#55), [SELFDESTRUCT](/#FF), [CALL](/#F1), and some EOF opcodes include [EOFCREATE](/#EC), [EXTCALL](/#F8) if the [value](/#34) sent is not 0.

If the size of the [return data](/about) is not known, it can also be retrieved after the call with the instructions [RETURNDATASIZE](/#3D) and [RETURNDATACOPY](/#3E) (since the Byzantium fork), or load 32-byte word onto the stack with [RETURNDATALOAD](/#F7) instruction.

## Stack input

0. `target_address`: the account which [context](/about) to execute.
1. `input_offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the [calldata](/about) of the sub [context](/about).
2. `input_size`: byte size to copy (size of the [calldata](/about)).

## Stack output

0. `status`: return 0 for success, 1 for revert if the sub [context](/about) [reverted](/#FD), 2 for failure.

## Examples

*TBD: See in playground.*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- Has positive value.
- The target address has more than 20 bytes.
- The target account code is legacy code (pre-EOF).
