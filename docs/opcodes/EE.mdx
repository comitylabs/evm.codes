*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Context from [EOFCREATE](/#EC), it loads auxiliary data from memory stack and that will be appended to deployed container's data. 

The container index and auxiliary data are used to construct deployed contract.

Should deployment succeed, the account's [code](/about) is set to the [return data](/about) resulting from executing the initialisation code.

## Immediate argument 

0. `deploy_container_index`: 8-bit unsigned value as the index of EOF containers.

## Stack input

0. `aux_data_offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes.
1. `aux_data_size`: byte size to copy (size of the auxiliary data).

## Examples

*TBD: See in playground*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- The current execution context is from a [EXTSTATICCALL](/#FB).
- Exceed the maximum data section size.
- Less than data section size declared in the header.
